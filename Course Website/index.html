            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>The world that we live in is changing dramatically over the period of time ever since man revolutionized the world by the invention of the modern technologies that we now use and encounter in our daily lives. One of such is called the internet. A term for the internet which best describes its purpose is the information superhighway. When used expertly, basically the internet gives you the power to shrink the world with the use of your computer to gain access to information and knowledge on almost every subject matter that you are curious about with only the use of the palm of your hands. The internet or the information superhighway was first called as “ARPANET,” and was a project in the 1960s for the defense force in the United States connecting several computers located across the country with one another. The objective or the concern regarding the project was that if any computer in a certain location was destroyed by enemies, the remaining computers in other locations would still continue to function. In the present generation, the internet is regarded as a massive network of networks which connects millions of computers around the globe to each other, which enables communication of each computer possible as long as they are both connected to the internet.</p>

            <h2 id="internet">The Internet</h2>

            <p>The internet has revolutionized the world of computers and communications. It is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for interaction between individuals and their computers without physical presence. A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide.</p>

            <p>The very first traces of social interactions that could be enabled via networking was during in August 1962. It was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT. He was the first head of the coputer research program at DARPA, starting in October 1962. While at DARPA, he convinced many other colleagues, which are Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, regarding the importance of networking concept.</p>
            
            <p>Vinton Cerf is known as the father of the internet. He is the co-designer of TCP/IP protocols and the architecture of the internet. He began his work in DARPA, responsibe for identifying new enabling technologies to support the development of advanced, Internet-based products and services.
            </p>

            <h2 id="WWW">The World Wide Web</h2>

            <p>The World Wide Web is a global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, as e-mail does.</p>

            <p>Tim-Berners Lee is known to be the father of the World Wide Web. In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. The World Wide Web was introduced in 1969 and established in 1989.</p>
